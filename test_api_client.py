Primarily, the CPSC works by enforcing adherence to laws like the Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act. It conducts product testing, market surveillance, and initiates recalls or bans on non-compliant products. The CPSC also facilitates the creation of voluntary standards and collaborates with corporations for designing safer products. The organization operates primarily within the United States but works alongside international bodies for global product safety enhancements. CPSC's activities include setting mandatory safety standards and conducting compliance verification, and it remains an authoritative entity for product recalls and hazard reports.",
